    This seems like a more straightforward project, so I'm going to actually spend less time on this one. Not like the tic-tac-toe project.
    This restaurant page will look good, and I'll probably try to make it work on mobile, but outside of that there's not much room for fancy shit, so I'll avoid adding any. Also, waiting for webpack to rebuild the site sucks. Even if it's just a few extra seconds.

    On track to actually make this a quick project. I think this one was made to be a little shorter anyway. Fixed the image hover animation so that looks pretty good now. Added a nav bar. Or nav bubble. Basically drew it on paper and remade it. On paper it was a little fancier and a lot goofier, but I think it looks nice as it is. Also made a neat little home page gallery. Was a slight bitch to set up, and it too doesn't work exactly as I imagined. At least it doesn't freak out from time to time like the flexbox version did. Anyway, success! A short project that I am pretty happy with and finished in a reasonable time frame.
