# restaurant-page
Restaurant page project for the Odin Project.


---Devlog---

May 7th, 2022

    This seems like a more straightforward project, so I'm going to actually spend less time on this one. Not like the tic-tac-toe project.
    This restaurant page will look good, and I'll probably try to make it work on mobile, but outside of that there's not much room for fancy shit, so I'll avoid adding any. Also, waiting for webpack to rebuild the site sucks. Even if it's just a few extra seconds.
